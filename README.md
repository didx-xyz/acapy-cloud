ðŸš§ This project is currently under development. If you would like to use
this in production, please [contact us](mailto:info@didx.co.za) first to discuss your use case.

## Overview

This project comprises a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application built
around [ACA-Py](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/aries-cloudagent-python),
primarily tailored for [Yoma](https://yoma.world)-specific use cases.

The main [app](app) provides an API interface
that simplifies complex self-sovereign identity (SSI) workflows. Using our
[ACA-Py controller](https://github.com/didx-xyz/aries-cloudcontroller-python), it
provides a streamlined layer of abstraction for client applications (e.g., a
mobile app) to interact within an SSI ecosystem.

What would normally require multiple calls to ACA-Py can be condensed into a single call
through this API. For example, onboarding an issuer â€” which involves creating a wallet,
establishing a connection with an endorser, generating a public DID, accepting the
Transaction Author Agreement (TAA), publishing the DID to the ledger, and awaiting
confirmation â€” can all be achieved with a single API call. Convenient, isn't it?

We simplify several key capabilities, including:

- Creating and managing wallets
- Onboarding issuers and verifiers
- Managing connections between parties
- Creating schemas and credential definitions
- Issuing verifiable credentials and handling revocations
- Requesting and validating proofs

To enable this, the project includes essential supporting services:

- An [Endorser](endorser) agent and service for authorizing ledger transactions
- A [Trust Registry](trustregistry) implementation for authorizing valid issuers, verifiers,
  and approved credential schemas
- A webhooks service ([Waypoint](waypoint)) for real-time, server-sent event
  (SSE) notifications and updates

You can find more detailed documentation in the [docs folder](docs/README.md).
The `Quick Start`, `Common Steps` and `Example Flows` will be most useful.

## How to Run It

> [!NOTE]
> For local development we now use Tilt and Kind instead of Docker Compose.
> Legacy Docker Compose files are still available, but deprecated and will be
> removed in the future.

Running the project is straightforward â€” it's all containerized. Simply execute
`mise run tilt:up` from the project root. This command will spin up a Kind
cluster, build all the necessary docker images, and start the project.
You can then visit [localhost:10350](http://localhost:10350) to access the Tilt
UI.

### Requirements

To run the project, you will need Docker and docker-compose, as well as the
ability to run a POSIX shell (e.g., sh or bash).

To install Docker, follow the instructions for your operating system in the
[official docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Next, follow the instructions for docker-compose in
[their docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

If you experience any issues while running the project, feel free to reach out
by opening an issue or contacting one of the contributors.

### Setting up Mise

This project makes use of [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) to install and manage
dev tooling.

There are several options for installing Mise:

```sh
# Homebrew
brew install mise

# Build from source (if you have Rust installed)
cargo install mise

# Arch Linux User Repository
yay -S mise-bin

# Debian/Ubuntu APT (amd64)
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install -y gpg wget curl
sudo install -dm 755 /etc/apt/keyrings
wget -qO - https://mise.jdx.dev/gpg-key.pub \
  | gpg --dearmor \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/mise-archive-keyring.gpg 1> /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/mise-archive-keyring.gpg arch=amd64] https://mise.jdx.dev/deb stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mise.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mise

# Debian/Ubuntu APT (arm64)
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install -y gpg wget curl
sudo install -dm 755 /etc/apt/keyrings
wget -qO - https://mise.jdx.dev/gpg-key.pub \
  | gpg --dearmor \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/mise-archive-keyring.gpg 1> /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/mise-archive-keyring.gpg arch=arm64] https://mise.jdx.dev/deb stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mise.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mise
```

We _strongly_ recommend using your system package manager to install Mise.

Additional installation documentation can be found
[here](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#alternate-installation-methods)

Once you have Mise installed, you will need to activate it in your shell.

```sh
# Bash
echo 'eval "$(mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

# Zsh
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc

# Fish
echo 'mise activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish && source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Once Mise is installed and activated, you can run `mise trust` and then
`mise install` to install all the required tools.

Other shells are supported as well. Please refer to the
[Mise documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#shells) for more
information.

> [!NOTE]
> At the time of writing, Mise
> [does not support Windows](https://mise.jdx.dev/faq.html#windows-support).
> WSL is recommended for Windows users.
>
> If you are using WSL, you will need to take some
> [additional steps](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/using-wsl2/) for Kind to
> work.

## Running Tests

The tests use `pytest`. For convenience, use Mise to run them. First, ensure
the project is running locally by executing `mise run tilt:up`. In another shell,
you can now run `mise run tests` to run all tests or `mise run tests:unit` to run
only the unit tests.

```bash
mise run tilt:up
```

Install the requirements:

```bash
mise run poetry:install
```

To run the tests you need to set up some environment variables to point Pytest
at the correct endpoints.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
source .env
```

Then you can run the tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest .
```

Or only the unit tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest --ignore=app/tests/e2e
```

You can specify the log level of the pytest output by using the `--log-cli-level`
flag.

```bash
poetry run pytest . --log-cli-level=DEBUG
```

This will output all log messages with a log level of `DEBUG` or higher.

To run specific tests, you can specify the path to the test file and the test
method. For example:

```bash
poetry run pytest \
  app/tests/e2e/test_verifier_oob.py::test_accept_proof_request_oob \
  --log-cli-level=1
```

## Running containerised tests

```bash
mise run tilt:up
```

In another terminal:

```bash
helmfile apply \
  --environment local \
  -f ./tilt/.charts/helmfiles/aries-capi-test.yaml
```
