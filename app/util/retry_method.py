    or until a maximum number of attempts is reached.

    Args:
        coroutine_func (Callable): The coroutine function to be called. It should be awaitable.
        args (Tuple): The arguments to pass to the coroutine function.
        field_name (str): The name of the field in the returned object to check against the expected value.
        expected_value (Any): The value that the coroutine should return for the call to be considered successful.
        logger (Logger): Logger instance used to log information and warnings about the retry attempts and exceptions.
        max_attempts (int, optional): The maximum number of attempts to make. Defaults to 5.
        retry_delay (int, optional): The delay in seconds between attempts. Defaults to 2.

    Returns:
        Any: The result of the coroutine if it matches the expected value within the allowed number of attempts.
             Returns `None` if the maximum number of attempts is reached without achieving the expected result.

        Exception: Re-raises any exception encountered on the final attempt.
