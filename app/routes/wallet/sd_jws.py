    Sign Selective Disclosure for JWS (SD-JWS)
    ---

    This endpoint allows the user to sign a Selective Disclosure for JWS (SD-JWS).
    The endpoint returns an SD-JWS that can be used to selectively disclose attributes
    to a verifier.

    When populating the body of the request, the user must provide either the
    did or the verification_method field.

    If an issuer signs a JWS with a did:sov DID, the DID must be public.

    The difference between the did and verification_method fields is:

     - If the did field is used, the Aries agent will make an educated guess about
       which verkey associated with the DID to use for signing the JWT.
     - If the verification_method field is used, the user explicitly specifies which
       verkey to use for signing the JWT, i.e., the DID with the associated key.

    The header field is optional and can be used to specify the header of the JWS.
    The typ, alg, and kid fields in the header are automatically populated by the Aries agent.

    The non_sd_list field is a list of non-selective disclosure attributes.
    These attributes are not included in the selective disclosure; i.e., they are always disclosed.
    If an attribute is a list or a dictionary, the attribute name should be included
    in the non_sd_list.
    In such cases, the attribute itself will be disclosed in the SD-JWS, but not
    the values in the list or the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

    Values in a list can be added to the non_sd_list by including the attribute
    name and the range of the list in the following format:

    "<attribute_name>[start:end]"

     - start is the start of the range as a int.
     - end is the end of the range (exclusive).

    Values in a dictionary can be added to the non_sd_list by specifying the
    dictionary name followed by the attribute name in the following format:

    "<dictionary_name>.<attribute_name>"

     - <dictionary_name> is the name of the dictionary.
     - <attribute_name> is the attribute name within the dictionary.

    The endpoint will return the signed SD-JWS along with the disclosures needed
    to reveal the attributes in the SD-JWS:

    <Issuer-signed JWS>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure N>

    It is the holderâ€™s responsibility to identify which disclosure corresponds to
    which attributes in the SD-JWS.
    The holder must provide the SD-JWS with the appropriate disclosures to the
    verifier upon request.

    See https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-07.html
    for the SD-JWT / SD-JWS spec.
