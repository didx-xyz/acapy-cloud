    Create connection invitation
    ---
    This endpoint creates an invitation object for establishing a connection with another tenant.

    For every invitation that is created, there will be a corresponding connection record with a state
    `invitation-sent`. Once this invitation is accepted, the connection record will transition to a state `completed`.

    If `multi_use` is set to true, the invitation can be re-used and accepted by multiple tenants.

    Creating a multi-use invitation will create a connection record with `invitation_mode: "multi"`
    (instead of `"once"`), and this connection record will remain in a state `invitation-sent`, until it is deleted.
    Every time a multi-use invitation is accepted, a new connection record will be created with state `completed`.

    The `use_public_did` parameter determines whether to create an invitation using your public DID.
    This of course requires that you have a public DID in your wallet, which by default is only true for issuers.
    If `use_public_did` is set to False (default behaviour), then a random DID will be generated for this invite.

    Request Body:
    ---
        body: CreateInvitation
            alias: str (Optional)
                An alias for the connection invitation, which will appear as the alias in the connection record.
            multi_use: bool (default: False)
                Whether the invitation can be used multiple times.
            use_public_did: bool (default: False)
                Whether to use a public did for the invitation.

    Returns:
    ---
        InvitationResult
            Contains an invitation object, an invitation url, and a connection id for this invite.

    string after the "?oob=" parameter in the url, and this can be decoded to obtain the invitation object.

    A webhook event will be emitted for the other party, on topic `connections`.
