### test_clear_pending_revokes_anoncreds (Skipped in regression run)

For anoncreds case just asserts that the endpoint responds with `501` i.e. not implemented for `askar-anoncreds` wallet type.

Assert it state is still `issued` and assert you can't clear it from the list again.

Not clear all for a `rev_reg_id`

### test_clear_pending_revokes_bad_payload_anoncreds (Skipped in regression run)

Try to clear pending revocations with badly formatted payloads, assert pydantic model raises `422`.

### test_publish_all_revocations_for_rev_reg_id_anoncreds (Skipped in regression run)

Faber calls publish pending with `rev_rec_id: []` and asserts that all credentials' state,
that were pending for `rev_reg`, has changed to `revoked`

### test_publish_all_revocations_no_payload_anoncreds (Skipped in regression run)

Faber calls publish pending with empty payload i.e. `"revocation_registry_credential_map": {}`

Then asserts that all credentials' state, that were pending for the fixture, has changed to `revoked`

### test_publish_one_revocation_anoncreds (Skipped in regression run)

Faber calls publish pending with `rev_rec_id: [cred_rev_id]`

Then asserts that the credential's state, with `cred_rev_id` used in call, has changed to `revoked`

### test_publish_revocations_bad_payload_anoncreds (Skipped in regression run)

Try to publish pending revocations with badly formatted payloads, assert pydantic model raises `422`.

In last case raises `404`, as `rev_reg_id` that is used, does not exist.

### test_get_pending_revocations_anoncreds (Skipped in regression run)

Faber calls get_pending with `rev_reg_id` and assert that there is 3 or more pending revocations after fixture setup.

### test_get_pending_revocations_bad_payload_anoncreds (Skipped in regression run)

Call `get_pending` with bad `rev_reg_id`. Aassert `404` (anoncreds does not validate `rev_reg_id`)

### test_fix_rev_reg_bad_id_anoncreds (Skipped in regression run)

Call `fix_rev_reg` with bad ids. Assert `422` for id with bad format and `404` for ids that don't exist.

AnonCreds test skipped bc no validation on `rev_reg_ids` for AnonCreds.
