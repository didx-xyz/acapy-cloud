    This method asserts that there is an actor registered in the trust registry

    and will also make sure the specified schema_id is registered as a valid schema.
    Raises an exception if one of the assertions fail.

    NOTE: the dids in the registry are registered as fully qualified dids. This means
    when passing a did to this method it must also be fully qualified (e.g. `did:sov:xxxx`)

        did (str): the did of the issuer in fully qualified format.

            or the schema is not registered in the registry.
