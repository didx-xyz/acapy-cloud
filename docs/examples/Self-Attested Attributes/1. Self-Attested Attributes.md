# Self-Attested Attributes

ACA-Py allows a holder/prover to respond to proof requests with self-attested values for requested attributes.
This means the prover can provide values that are not represented by credentials in their wallet.

## Responding with self-attested attributes

If a prover receives a proof request they can respond with self-attested values.
However if there are restrictions on these attributes and the prover responds with self-attested attributes,
then the proof will fail.

Let's take a look at how to respond with `self_attested_attributes`.

Below a verifier will send a proof request, requesting the prover's `name` and `cell_number`.

The verifier sends the proof request:

```http
POST  /v1/verifier/send-request
```

```json
{
  "protocol_version": "v2",
  "comment": "Demo",
  "type": "indy",
  "indy_proof_request": {
    "requested_attributes": {
      "given_name": { "name": "name" },
      "cellphone": { "name": "cell_number" }
    },
    "requested_predicates": {}
  },
  "save_exchange_record": true,
  "connection_id": "38f14bc4-4ec5-42bc-8f69-ffe8f792dfaf"
}
```

Taking a look at the proof request above, the verifier requested two different attributes with attribute
referents `given_name` and `cellphone`, each requesting attribute `name` and `cell_number` respectively.

Take a look at how the prover responds to the proof below, specifically in regard to the attribute referent
`cellphone`. By doing this, the prover is able to provide a value that they don't have in their credentials.

```http
POST /v1/verifier/accept-request
```

```json
{
  "proof_id": "v2-d0d0e554-ce14-492e-935e-64a7be72ec5b",
  "type": "indy",
  "indy_presentation_spec": {
    "requested_attributes": {
      "given_name": {
        "cred_id": "cb844509-c687-48aa-bbea-dbaecca28a11",
        "revealed": true
      }
    },
    "requested_predicates": {},
    "self_attested_attributes": {
      "cellphone": "0123456789"
    }
  },
  "dif_presentation_spec": {}
}
```

In the verifier's proof record below, we can see the values the prover responded with can be found
under `self_attested_attrs`.

```

Note that the proof is valid (`verified: true`), and that the prover's cellphone number is available in
the `self_attested_attrs` section as `cell_number`, the name of the requested attribute.
