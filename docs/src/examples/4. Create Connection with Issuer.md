# 4: Create Connection

Now that the Issuer has a credential definition, they can start issuing
credentials. However, in order to do that, they first need to create a
connection to the holder. There are multiple ways to create connections. We will
use the `/v1/connections/` endpoints in these examples.

## Create connection between Holder and Issuer

`POST /v1/connections/did-exchange/create-request`

This endpoint allows a tenant to send a request to another tenant with a public
DID to create a connection. Tenants on the platform are configured to auto-accept
connections; therefore, connections will proceed to completion automatically.

The following parameters are available on the endpoint:

- `their_public_did` The DID of the party you want to connect to.
- `alias` An alias for the connection. Defaults to None.
- `goal` Optional self-attested string for sharing the intent of the connection.
- `goal_code` Similar to goal.
- `my_label` Will be the wallet label, can be overwritten.
- `use_did` Your local DID to use for the connection.
- `use_did_method` The method to use for the connection: "did:peer:2" or "did:peer:4".
- `use_public_did` Use your public DID for this connection. Defaults to False.

> Note: Only one of `use_did`, `use_did_method` or `use_public_did` should be specified.
> If none of these are specified, a new local DID will be created for this
> connection.

As the `Holder`, we create a connection with the `Issuer` using the did-exchange
protocol.

}
```

Both tenants can listen to [Webhooks](../Webhooks.md) to track the progress of
the connection being made. Once the `state` is `completed`, the connection is
established. This can also be verified by fetching connection records for the holder or
issuer, and validating that their connection has transitioned to state: `completed`.

Below is an example of a webhook event indicating the `completed` state.

> the `Issuer` will be different from that of the `Holder`, even though they refer
> to the same connection.
