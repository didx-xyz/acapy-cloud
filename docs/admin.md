### Admin Agent

Both aca-py agents are exposed via the same Swagger UI under the same url. They are distinguished under the hood via the authorization method which also specifies a role. Please, refer to the workflows doc for further information.

The admin agent is a non-multitenant agent for general admin representing YOMA or in a broader sense of speaking the admin entity. This agent can be used to create schemas, manage actors (against the trust registry), and managing wallets.
