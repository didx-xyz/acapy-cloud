# Dockerfile Pip Requirements

## Installing Poetry with pinned hashes

The `poetry-requirements.txt` file is used to install poetry for the different dockerfiles.

This requirements file is generated by `pip-compile`, which requires pip-tools.

```sh
pip install pip-tools
```

Set the desired poetry version in the `poetry-version.in` file:

```txt
poetry==2.1.3
```

To generate the poetry requirements file with pinned hashes, run:

```sh
cd dockerfiles
pip-compile --generate-hashes poetry-version.in
mv poetry-version.txt poetry-requirements.txt  # Rename the resulting file
```
